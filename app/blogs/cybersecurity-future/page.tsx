          As the Internet of Things grows exponentially, so do the
          vulnerabilities that threaten our digital infrastructure. The
          interconnected nature of modern technology has created new attack
          vectors that traditional security measures simply cannot address
          effectively.

          The Evolving Threat Landscape
        </h2>

        <p>
          Cybercriminals are becoming more sophisticated, utilizing AI and
          machine learning to automate attacks and find new vulnerabilities.
          From ransomware attacks that can cripple entire organizations to
          state-sponsored cyber warfare, the stakes have never been higher.
        </p>

        <h2
          style={{
            color: "#e2631f",
            fontWeight: "700",

          Next-Generation Security Solutions
        </h2>

        <p>
          Modern cybersecurity relies on multiple layers of protection:
          AI-powered threat detection systems that can identify anomalies in
          real-time, zero-trust architecture that assumes no user or device is
          inherently trustworthy, and edge computing solutions that process
          sensitive data closer to its source.
        </p>

        <p>
          The future of cybersecurity lies not just in reactive measures, but
          in predictive systems that can anticipate and prevent attacks before
          they occur. As we move forward, the integration of quantum
          encryption and blockchain technology will provide even stronger
          foundations for digital security.
